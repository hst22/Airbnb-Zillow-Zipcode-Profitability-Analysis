# Airbnb-Zillow-Zipcode-Profitability-Analysis

Hello,
Thank you for taking out time for this repository.

This is a case study that I did on Airbnb and Zillow data set. It contains the profitabilty analysis for zipcodes, i.e. which zipcode
is the most profitable of all.

This repository contains the main report and the r code. 

Note: Due to technical glitches, a plot is missing from the main report of github version. However, the analysis made using the plot can be 
understood by the key observations below the missing plot. 

Thank you

Regards,
Hasnat Tahir
